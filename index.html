              New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on holistic 3D scene information or specifically designated regions for 3D vision-language tasks, failing to capture multi-level location-based information. Addressing these concerns, we present Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial perception and reasoning for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM incorporates an LLM backbone and a meticulously designed progressive spatial awareness scheme that captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings that serve as visual prompt. Additionally, we introduce two novel tasks, namely 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset MODEL, to inspire more profound 3D spatial perception capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information and the proposed dataset.

          In light of the mentioned deficiencies in existing 3D instruction datasets, we propose two novel tasks, namely 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing in 3D scenes, to evaluate the spatial perception capabilities of 3D MLLMs. We construct a 3D instruction dataset called measure object distance and layout editing (MODLE) that is furnished with 263K vision-language annotations specifically targeted towards these tasks. Inferring precise distances between objects enhances fine-grained spatial perception, while performing object placement and movement in a 3D scene fosters a deeper understanding of object-scene spatial information, accumulating commonsense knowledge for downstream tasks.

          ["LLaVA", "When visiting this peaceful location with a pier extending over a serene lake, surrounded by mountains, there are several things to be cautious about. First, pay attention to the weather conditions, as sudden changes in weather, especially strong winds or storms, can cause the water to become rough and pose risks to the stability of the pier. Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.​​"],

            `Traveling to this picturesque location with a serene lake and mountains in the background was a refreshing and rejuvenating experience. The pier extending over the calm water provided an excellent vantage point from which to appreciate the breathtaking scenery. As I stood on the pier, I couldn't help but feel a deep connection with nature, taking a moment to soak in the peaceful atmosphere.​

One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the fishing experience. The area is teeming with life, and I was thrilled to land a sizeable catch, despite the modest size of the lake. The joy of fishing in such a beautiful setting was truly rewarding, and it allowed me to take a break from my busy life and truly immerse myself in the tranquility of nature.​

While exploring the surrounding area, I came across a family of birds that had built a nest close to the pier, adding to the charm of the location. Interacting with the wildlife and observing their behavior was an enriching experience that I'll cherish for years to come.​

In conclusion, this idyllic destination provided me with an opportunity to unwind and recharge, surrounded by mesmerizing natural beauty and the gentle sounds of water and wildlife. If you're looking for a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this pier overlooking the lake is the perfect place to find solace and reconnect with nature.`
